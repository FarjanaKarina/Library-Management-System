# 📚 Library Management System – Project Plan

This project is designed to build a **Library Management System** divided into **two main independent parts**, allowing both team members to work in parallel with minimal dependencies.
Each part covers both **entity management** and **process-oriented** modules.

## 🤝 Shared Responsibilities

| Responsibility              | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial Database Design** | Both members collaborate to define the database schema and relationships before starting development.        |

| **Notifications & Alerts**  | Shared responsibility — divided based on module needs.                                                       |
| **Testing & Deployment**    | Each member tests their modules independently, followed by **integration and system-level testing**.         |

## 🏗️ Development Phases

1. **Phase 1:** Database design & schema alignment
2. **Phase 2:** Independent module development
3. **Phase 3:** Integration & end-to-end testing
4. **Phase 4:** UI/UX refinement and deployment
